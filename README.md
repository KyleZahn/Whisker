# Whisker
A Tinder-themed app that utilizes the Petfinder API. Created with React Native.

## How it works

Users are able to find pets up for adoption in their area and can refine their search by sex, age, size, and type of animal.

When a user 'swipes right' on a pet, it is added to their favorites (in AysncStorage) only if the pet has not already been added.

Once a pet is added to favorites, the user can open the pet's information page to view all of the pet's photos, their description, shelter contact information, and location.
